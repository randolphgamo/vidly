# Introduction
this is a video rental app. I did this project as part of learning react on codewithmosh.com

## What did I learn
I learnt a couple of concepts and I could directly put them into practice in building this app:
Bootstrap
Props, History
Controllable Components
Life Cycle Hooks
Axios, Promises (await,async), calling backend services
Validation with Joi
Handling Errors (Expected and unexpected)
Logging with Sentry




# Setup
To run this project, you need its backend. This can be found at https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/vidly-api-node


## Install the Dependencies
Next, from the project folder, install the dependencies:

`npm i`
### launch the app
`npm start`
